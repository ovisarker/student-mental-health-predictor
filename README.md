# üß† Student Mental Health Prediction System

This is a web application built for a Final Year Project that uses Machine Learning to predict the risk levels of **Stress**, **Anxiety**, and **Depression** among university students based on survey responses and demographic data.

The goal of this project is to provide a scalable tool for early detection, helping universities connect students with appropriate mental health resources proactively.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Multi-Condition Prediction:** Predicts risk levels for three common mental health conditions.
-   **Interactive Survey:** A user-friendly web interface for inputting survey and demographic data.
-   **Explainable AI:** Built using a Logistic Regression model, which is highly interpretable.
-   **Tiered Support System:** Provides recommended resources based on the predicted risk level.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

-   **Backend & ML:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas
-   **Web Framework:** Streamlit
-   **Models:** Logistic Regression
-   **Deployment:** Streamlit Community Cloud
